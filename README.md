Hey all.  To get a sense of what I'm trying to make check out the 'Time 4 Exploration' game for android.

I'm not a professional programmer, as much as I'd like to think I am.  I've taken quite a few classes, but most of them were web dev.  Recently I've finished a Visual Basic class and this language is amazing.  I haven't tried some of the lower level languages like C,C++ but I hope to some day.

Today I'm working on a clone for the game above.  As I get a change I will post a github and make the project open source.  I'm excited to be using such a fun language and I'm wondering:

Does anyone have any advice for game dev in VB6?  The class I took focused on app design and never even coughed the word game.

This will not be ab exact clone and there's still a ways to go programing it.  After I started this game we started learning about the OOP side of VB6 so I've been converting the code to OOP, but some of it, like the buildings are still not yet updated.

There are still a lot of buildings to add and a lot to be done.  I felt like uploading this for you all to see to get a sense of how to do things right.  Thanks for any help.
